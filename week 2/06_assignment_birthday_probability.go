/* Assume a room with 20 people. What is the probability that two of
   them have the same birthday? For simplicity, say a year has 365 days.
   Day 1 is January 1 and day 365 is December 31.

   So, a birthday will be a number from 1 to 365.  Now compute whether 20
   people at random will have the same birthday. Do this 10000 times to
   get a reasonable sample.  Also do this for 10, 20, 30 ,.. 100 people
   in the room and print this as a table.

	 limitations: cause arrays and functions are not taught till this
	 assignment, I assume that we have to use basic tools such as loops,
	 variables, and if condition!
