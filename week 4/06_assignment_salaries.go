/* Write a GO program that examines employee’s salaries stored in a map. The map
   has employee name as the key and salary as an int value. You wish to find and
   print the employee name with the smallest salary, and the employee name with
   the largest salary as well as the company’s average salary.

   This program should generate the map by reading, from the file provided below,
   the name and salary of employees.

   Its form will be first_name last_ name salary (string string int) e.g. Ira Pohl
   77700

   It will be one per line in the file.

   If you use a map, then you can make a string the key and the salary the value
   and use the names concatenated as the key, e.g. Ira.Pohl 77700 will be the map
   element.

   Alternatively, you could read the name and salary into two arrays. You could
   process the two arrays to find out these answers.
