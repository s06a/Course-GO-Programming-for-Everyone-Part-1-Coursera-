/* Write a GO program that improves on the
  class program for Rock-Paper-Scissors.

  This program should adjust its strategy to
  that of its opponent. For example, if it sees
  that the user is only playing rock then it
  should switch to playing scissors. This might
  be considered a simple form of machine learning.
  One way to do this is to keep track of the users'
  plays and after some time, say every ten plays,
  adjust the machine strategy to play using this
  knowledge.

  Assume a match is 100 plays.
